    <h2>Inspiration and Idea</h2>
        <p>
            When it came to a final project, the only concept I knew I wanted to explore more was how to utilize an audio visualizer and creat pleasant scenes that can be customizable by the user. Since winter came around, I knew I wanted something festive but something that also made the user want to look forward to the sunny weather again. Therefore, I utilized various shapes and created unique scenes that took me hours planning out on paper and then having to figure out how to create using Canvas. This project consists of trial and error but also in some cases started from scratch as ideas constantly changed.

            In terms of programming, here is a list of resources and how I utilized them for this project.

            <dd>
                - I utilized a similiar layout in terms of header and footer to keep all my projects sharing a similiar theme and idea. This allows the projects to give off simplicity and creativity.

                - To make the project have more of a spark or unique feature, I used the function for displaying a random color choice when it came to making the ornaments that are displayed in the Winter Wonderland theme.

            <dd>
                - The original aspect where circles would symbolize the beat of the song was a really interesting concept to me. I found a way to make it more unique by simply using it to inspire the fireflies option. It changes softly based on the beats of the song and it gives a slight glow similiar to that of fireflies. This can best be seen when using a dark background color.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                - This entire project was based off the bare minimum of what was completed during this homework. I simply built off it using shapes to form unique scenes and allow the player to customize it as they chose.

                - Any source of code from importing sprites as seen in one example such as in my function drawDetailedSnowFlakes() is from Spicy Yoghurt's website and their tutorial on importing sprites and sizing them.
