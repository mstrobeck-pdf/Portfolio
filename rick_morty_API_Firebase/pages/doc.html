        <h2>Idea & Why It Changed</h2>
        <p>
            Originally going into this project, I wanted to focus on a Pokemon API. 
            I had a large range of plans for it such as sorting Pokemon by release date, 
            the games you could find them in, and so much more. However, this idea quickly changed 
            the moment my computer crashed and I lost a good person to me. This affected my mental 
            health enough that this project became too much so I resulted back to my API from 235 
            which was a <a href="https://people.rit.edu/mrs8402/235/RickMortyAPI/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Rick & Morty API.</a> From here, my focus was to implement fetch and attempt to 
            create a functional favorite character page but this unfortunely created issues for me. While creating this project, I completely started fresh with my CSS 
            design and used Bulma to create beautiful use of columns.

        <p>
            In terms of programming, here is a list of resources and how I utilized them for this project.
        </p>

                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Using Fetch</a>
            </dt>

            <dd>- I used Mozilla to help me properly utilize a fetch function that is called and activated in order to pull
                all the data that is needed. Coming into this assignment, I was struggling with fetch but this resource helped me understand
                it to a better extent.
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <a href="" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Firebase Dog Example </a> & <a href="https://people.rit.edu/mrs8402/330/homework/firebase/firebase-admin.html" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Firebase Admin </a>
            </dt>

            <dd>- When trying to add favorites to the community page, I relied on the example done in class using dogs and then the fire-base admin homework assignment to add a button that allows the user to say the term they searched was a favorite
                and that "liking of the term" updates my firebase to log another like on the community page! I struggled getting the button to log a specific character so unless you write the exact name in the searchbox, your term in the search will be submitted to the community page.

            <dd>
                -I referanced the code they gave when trying to output api information onto the phyiscal page rather than the console.

                <a href="https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/" style="text-decoration: underline;"> Bulma</a>
            </dt>

            <dd>- I used Bulma's documentation and start guide to import it into my css file and help create a clean layout. For example, my use of columns
                where all my links are.
            </dd>

            <dt> <a href="https://people.rit.edu/mrs8402/235/RickMortyAPI/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Rick & Morty API</a></dt>
            <dd>- Lastly, I used the code from my previous API that I created for an old project and found a use to repurpose it in 
                order to make life easier and help my mental state.
